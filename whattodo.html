    <p>
      There is lots to do in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. From skiing on the world famous alps mountain range to visiting the vineyards of Rhône valley, there is always something to do.
    <br><br>
There are numerous mountain ranges to ski on whilst visiting Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. Apart from the Alps mountain range, there is massif central, another, less known about, mountain range to ski on. Ain is another mountain range. Sharing a border with switzerland, the area is mostly rural.
    <br><br>
Aside from skiing, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes has Lac d’Annecy, a glacial lake said to be the cleanest lake in all of Europe. Lac d'Annecy is absolutely perfect for cycling or walking around and with a large variety of vessels provided for rent, you can canoe over the lake. Wildlife thrives around the outer parts of the lakes, from kingfishers to herons on land and brown trout to blennies underwater, the vicinity is sure to keep you occupied.
    <br><br>
Reach the summit of Chamonix via a world record breaking cable car. After ascending 2,807 metres you can take the lift up to terrace glaze to catch a glimpse of the amazing view. Additionally you can get a meal up at the summit or (if you’re brave enough) walk the skywalk which is a glass box with a 1000 metre drop beneath your feet.
