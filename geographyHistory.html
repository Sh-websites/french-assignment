      Auvergne-Rh么ne-Alpes is a French region created by the territorial reform of French Regions in 2014.
      The region is over 69,711 km2  in area making it the third largest in metropolitan France. Accompanied with
      the lush green landscapes and the mountainous ranges, this region also has a long history.
<br><br>
A good 30,000 years ago, humans inhabited and settled in Auvergne Rhone Alpes forming the first examples of art on interior walls.
The celts made it to the region in the 6th century BC, followed in 218 BC by Hannibal and the Carthaginians, and finally, the might of the
 Roman Empire. For over 5 centuries,  the Romans continued to evolve the region building roads and other conveniences to improve the life of those
 already living there.
<br><br>
Throughout the 16th century, Auvergne-Rh么ne-Alpes was in the middle of a religious war leading to the destruction of numerous towns and villages.
 In the 18th century, Lyon (currently the major commercial centre for the French silk industry) resisted revolutionary forces, maintaining its prosperity
  and proving itself resistant against the nazis.
